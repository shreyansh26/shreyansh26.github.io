I am a **Principal Machine Learning Engineer at [Level AI](https://thelevel.ai/)**, where I lead a distributed team across India and the USA. We tackle complex NLP challenges at scale, specifically focusing on building and scaling large language models (LLMs) to extract valuable insights from contact-center conversations. My work also involves optimizing LLM training and inference, delving into kernel development, and pushing the boundaries of ML systems engineering.

Before Level AI, I worked as a **Data Scientist at [Mastercard's AI Garage](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mastercard-ai-garage/)**, where I developed AI models to enhance transaction security and intelligence. My career has been primarily focused on **applied research**, bridging the gap between innovation and real-world applications. This includes launching AI-driven products and contributing to research published in AI conferences.

I earned my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT (BHU) Varanasi** under the mentorship of [Prof. K.K. Shukla](https://iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/kkshuklacse), where I worked on privacy-preserving machine learning in healthcare. I also explored adversarial machine learning and malware classification. My internships spanned diverse fields, including 5G mobility at [Samsung Research Institute - Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) and malware detection at the [C3i Institute, IIT Kanpur](https://security.cse.iitk.ac.in/).

In the past, I was an avid CTF player (handle [wr47h](https://ctftime.org/team/34870)), competing either individually or with my team [Abs0lut3Pwn4g3](https://ctftime.org/team/72103). I also enjoy reading thrillers, fiction and biographies whenever I have the time.
